  "readme": "# ampersand-sync\n\nStandalone, modern-browser-only version of Backbone.Sync as Common JS module.\n\nYou probably won't use this directly, but it is used by ampersand-model and ampersand-rest-collection to provide the REST functionality.\n\n## Important note on the 1.0.x versions\n\nIn moving from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2 we switched the underlying ajax implementation from jQuery's ajax to [xhr](http://github.com/raynos/xhr). This changed slightly the options, as well as how `ajaxConfig` in models/collections operated when configured as a function.\n\nPreviously `ajaxConfig` would be passed the current ajax parameters object for modification, now it receives no arguments and should just return options to be merged in to the ajax parameters which will be passed to xhr.\n\nThis should have been a major release both for this module and it's dependents (ampersand-model, ampersand-rest-collection, ampersand-collection-rest-mixin), but unfortunately we made a mistake and published as 1.0.2, and were too slow to rollback our mistake before workarounds were in place.\n\nAs such we are leaving the current 1.0.x versions in place, but deprecated, and suggest people upgrade to the latest versions of model/collection when they can which will contain the new implementation of xhr.\n\nThis should only affect your if you're using `ajaxConfig` as a function. If so you'll need to return the options you want to add, rather than expecting to be passed a params object to your ajaxConfig function.
