## How to implement routing and manage different pages?

Introduce RouteIntent, RouteModel, and RouteView that are wired in a different way than the typical MVI cycle.

```
    ┌─────── Page1Intent ───> RouteIntent <─── Page2Intent ──────┐
    │              ^               │               ^             │
    │              │               V               │             │
    │              │           RouteModel          │             │
    │              │               │               │             │
    V              │               V               │             V
Page1Model ──> Page1View ────> RouteView <──── Page2View <── Page2Model
                                   │
                                   │
                                   V
                                Renderer
```

The idea is to represent the current page (or route) in a RouteModel, then to use a RouteView that consumes the RouteModel, but also consumes Page1View and Page2View. In other words, RouteView should take three inputs. Internally, RouteView is just a switch which redirects only from Page1View if and only if the RouteModel has emitted 'page1' as the current page, or redirects only Page2View if RouteModel emits 'page2'. Then RouteIntent consumes Page1Intent and Page2Intent, the two latter should exports events indicating that the user wants to change the page. For instance, Page1Intent might have an event stream called `goToPage2$`. RouteIntent aggregates these types of events, and the RouteModel will listen to those.
