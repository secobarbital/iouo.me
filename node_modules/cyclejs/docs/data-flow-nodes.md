# Data Flow Nodes

Cycle.js uses the concept of a "Data Flow Nodes", which is very important for the
framework. It is a known concept from Data Flow, which also turns out to be a natural
solution to the circular dependency problem that arises from the cyclic structure between
Model, View, Intent. The problem consists of implementing the dependencies: Model depends
on Intent, Intent depends on View, View depends on Model.

```
  Model <───────┐
    │           │
    │           │
    V           │
  View ─────> Intent
```

Each of these nodes is supposed to work like a function, i.e., takes input, releases
output. However, it is impossible to express these using JavaScript functions. Here is a
naïve attempt:

```javascript
var x = foo(z);
var y = bar(x);
var z = baz(y);
```

`z` needs to be defined before `x` since we call `x = foo(z)`. But there isn't any way we
can reorder that to make it work. If we could somehow magically pass the arguments by name
and not by their values, then this problem could be solved as such:

```javascript
function addThree(a) {
  return a + 3;
}
var y = addThree(x); // x is still undefined here
var x = 2; // after this assignment, y should become 5
```

Certainly `addThree` is not a normal JavaScript function. Also, that snippet above assumes
that values are reactive, in the sense that `y` will change (according to `addThree`)
whenever `x` changes.

Hence, to solve the circular dependency problem in a reactive context, we can take
advantage of the fact that our values here are RxJS Observables as
inputs and outputs.

## What is a Data Flow Node?

A `DataFlowNode` is a node that receives RxJS Observables as input and outputs RxJS
Observables, with no side-effects. It is a JavaScript object that outputs Observables
before it receives Observables as inputs. The output exists before the input parameter is
given. It is not a JavaScript `Function`, but behaves like one.

To provide a `DataFlowNode` an input, call the `inject(input)` function:

```javascript
dataFlowNode.inject(inputObject);
```

Because the output of a DataFlowNode exists before the input is given, this also
means that each DataFlowNode can only yield one output. A DataFlowNode is therefore not
reusable for multiple inputs, like normal functions are.

## Anatomy of a Data Flow Node

You create a `DataFlowNode` by calling

```javascript
var dataFlowNode = Cycle.defineDataFlowNode(inputInterface, definitionFn);
```

The output is an instance of `DataFlowNode`, which contains the actual output RxJS
Observables that you expect, plus the `inject` function. `definitionFn` is a normal
JavaScript function with an input object as parameter, and must return an object whose
properties are RxJS Observables. `inputInterface` is an array of strings defining which
properties must exist in the input object given to `definitionFn`.

Internally, `DataFlowNode` works by creating a stub for the input, creating RxJS
Subjects with the names given by `inputInterface`. This stub is then given to the
`definitionFn` as the input parameter, which returns RxJS Observables depending on the
stub subjects. When `inject` is called with the real input object, all the events in the
Observables in the input (named according to `inputInterface`) are forwarded to the stub
observables. The stub, therefore, works as an early replacement to the real input, so we
can get an output without requiring the input. `inject` just commands the stub to mimic
the input.

As an example, if we call

```javascript
var dataFlowNode = Cycle.defineDataFlowNode(['foo$', 'bar$'], function(input) {
  return {
    baz$: Rx.Observable.merge(input.foo$, input.bar$)
  }
});
```

then the object `dataFlowNode` will contain the following properties:

```javascript
{
  baz$ // Rx.Observable
  inject // Function
  clone // Function
}
```

## Common pitfalls

- **Trying to reuse a DataFlowNode.** A `DataFlowNode` can only represent one instance
  of its output object. To reuse a DataFlowNode, call `clone()` on it to get another
  `DataFlowNode` (in essence, a different output).
- **Calling `inject` twice.** It should be called only once.
- **Using input properties not defined in `inputInterface`**. If you use `input.foo$`
  inside `definitionFn`, and `'foo$'` is not in the given `inputInterface` array, then
  `foo$` will be undefined in `definitionFn`. Make sure that you only use input properties
  that are defined in the `inputInterface`.
- **Not using RxJS Observables**. All properties in the input object should be RxJS
  Observables, and all properties in the output object of `definitionFn` should be RxJS
  Observables too. If you only need to output a single value, use `Rx.Observable.just()`.
  Use the convention of suffixing with `$` to denote that the property is an Observable.

# Data Flow Sinks

Sinks are similar to DataFlowNodes, except they only receive inputs, they do not produce
output. In Rx terminology, `DataFlowSink` should just **subscribe** to the input when it is
injected. As all other important components in Cycle.js, a `DataFlowSink` can also be
injected a dependency. Use Sinks for side-effects such as saving model data to
localStorage or to database in the backend.

## `DataFlowSink` API

**Create** a DataFlowSink by calling `Cycle.createDataFlowSink(definitionFn)` where
`definitionFn` expects Data Flow Nodes as inputs, and outputs an Rx.Disposable
(a subscription to the Observables in the input). The `DataFlowSink` returned by
`createDataFlowSink` contains an `inject` function that can be used in the same style as
DataFlowNode injects are.

**Inject** a dependency into a DataFlowSink by calling `inject(inputs...)`. The inject
simply calls the original `definitionFn` using the given `inputs...`.

# Data Flow Sources

Sources are the opposite of Sinks. A `DataFlowSource` only produces output, and does not
get inputs injected. They are much simpler because they do not have an `inject()`
function. To create a `DataFlowSource`, you call `Cycle.createDataFlowSource(output)`,
where `output` is the object containing Observables.

In practice, you can replace a DataFlowSource simply by the `output` object, and the
application will function exactly the same. Under the hood, `createDataFlowSource()` just
returns the same object it was given. The point of using `createDataFlowSource` is to have
the output object be an instance of `DataFlowSource`, to be consistent with `DataFlowNode`
and `DataFlowSink`.
